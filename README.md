# SORTING-VISUALIZER
Ever find yourself struggling to grasp how sorting algorithms really work? This web application provides an intuitive visual representation of various sorting algorithms, making their inner workings crystal clear.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort

## Features

- **Colored Representation**: Visualizes each step with specific colors:
  - Blue: Default state
  - Yellow: Elements being compared
  - Red: Elements identified as incorrectly positioned
  - Green: Elements in their correct positions

- **Visualization Controls**:
  - **Speed**: Control the speed of visualization with 5 different levels.
  - **Data Size**: Adjust the size of the data set to be sorted.
  - **Generate New Data**: Randomly generate new data for sorting.

- **Time and Space Complexity**: Displays the time and space complexity of each algorithm being visualized.

## Usage

1. Choose an algorithm from the provided buttons.
2. Adjust visualization controls (speed and data size) as needed.
3. Click "Generate New Array" to randomly generate new data for sorting.
4. Observe the sorting algorithm in action with colored visualizations and complexity information.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
